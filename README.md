# NLP Foundations: Financial Sentiment Analysis & Text Generation with TensorFlow

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (compatible with Google Colab) that applies NLP techniques to financial text analysis using TensorFlow. The notebook walks through preprocessing steps, builds a sentiment analysis model for financial news, and implements text generation with LSTMs to generate finance-related content.

## Overview

NLP in finance provides insights into market sentiment and aids in generating financial narratives. This notebook covers:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Steps for cleaning and preparing text data.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying financial news headlines into sentiment categories (e.g., optimism or caution).
3. **Text Generation with LSTMs**: Generating realistic financial sentences based on an input seed.

## Contents

- **1. Text Preprocessing**: Steps like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for text data preparation.
- **2. Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow**: Training a model to classify financial headlines based on sentiment.
- **3. Text Generation Using LSTM**: Using an LSTM model to generate realistic financial text, given a prompt.

---

## Dataset

The notebook uses the [Indian Financial News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hkapoor/indian-financial-news-articles-20032020) from Kaggle. Please download and upload it to your Colab environment as instructed in the notebook.

## Notebook Highlights

- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess financial news headlines.
- **Training the Model**: Run each cell sequentially to train models for sentiment analysis and text generation.
- **Results and Visualization**: Visualize training and validation accuracy/loss, with example generated text outputs.

## Results

This notebook demonstrates foundational NLP techniques for financial analysis, reaching reasonable training accuracy but showing potential overfitting. Future improvements could include more advanced models and a larger, diverse dataset to increase generalization.

## Future Improvements

Enhancements to consider:
- **Pre-trained embeddings** (e.g., GloVe) for richer text representation.
- **Transformer models** (e.g., BERT, GPT) to better capture context in sentiment and text generation tasks.
- **Data augmentation** to expand and diversify training data for better generalization.
